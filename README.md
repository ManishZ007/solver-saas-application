## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<a href="introduction">Introduction</a>


**Overview**

Solver is an AI-powered SaaS platform designed to help developers solve coding problems efficiently. The platform allows developers to share their coding challenges with the community or use AI to get immediate solutions. Users can post their problems privately for personal use or publicly to receive help from other developers. Additionally, the platform features customizable chat groups, where users can collaborate with others by creating groups with a unique name and password, enabling them to communicate and work together across the internet.


**Objective**

The primary objective of Solver is to bridge the gap between community-driven problem solving and AI assistance, empowering developers to tackle coding challenges in an efficient and collaborative manner. The platform aims to provide an easy-to-use, responsive interface where developers can quickly get the help they need, whether through community interaction or AI support. By offering these dual avenues for problem-solving, Solver helps developers save time, improve their coding skills, and grow within a collaborative environment.
